## Introduction

The primary goal is to create a simple abstraction for handling the HTTP interaction.

Library is made for interacting with Fracture\Routing. In addition to the implemented interface,
it also provides object-oriented abstractions for the following functionality:

- file uploads
- cookies
- headers (some of them)

## Instalation

Since the library is still in development, the recommended version to install would be "the latest". You can do it by running following command:

    composer require fracture/http:dev-master
